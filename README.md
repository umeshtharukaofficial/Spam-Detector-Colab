# Spam-Detector-Colab
A Machine Learning project classifying emails as 'spam' or 'ham' using NLP. Built in Google Colab, it demonstrates text preprocessing, feature engineering (TF-IDF), and supervised classification (e.g., Naive Bayes). This accessible, end-to-end solution automates junk mail filtering and provides a practical ML/NLP learning blueprint.
